# SQUINT Expert App
## SQUINT 
is an expert app which connects the photographer with the user to help him choosing the best picture for his needs. 
It provides proofing for images and photos capabilities and supports this with video chat and messaging. It also can connect the user with other stakeholders, which can be HR people, team leaders, project and family and friends.  The app is aimed to a corporate environment.
 
### Why is this important? 
 
*For the user:*
Because subtle differences in a portrait can have big impacts, while you might think you look very serious, others might perceive you as grim. Since there is not a second chance for a first impression, a professional outside view can help you to decide in a faster and more profound way.  Most people don`t like to judge, so with the help of others, the user will feel more secure and comfortable with his choice.

## Executive Summary
### Target Audience
The app SQUINT aims at professional photographers and other media professionals who need to proof a volume of images with clients in an easy and time saving way, while still providing expert advice. E.g.: commercial portrait photographers who work in high volume shots for corporations. Since there is a plugin for Capture One planned, users of the software are a target audience. It’s a B2B Audience, ranging from business starters to seasoned photographers 25-65 years old

### Competition
Competitors are sites such as picdrop.de, prodibi.com as well as complete solutions as SmugHut, Shootproof and Filecamp, Dam Systems, CMS with specialized plugins, like Word Press with picu.io plugin. LightroomCC and most filesharing services provide gallery views and comment options. Furthermore, scripts or automated actions in Zapier, Automate on top of folders could provide similar functionality. Plenty of competion
### Risk/Opportunity
One risk is that our app will get lost in the sea of competition. Or its functionality is provided by an existing solution, like the existing proofing gallery in Lightroom CC. There are a lot of popular apps that offer proofing and are already in use by photographers. It’s hard for us to stand out. To get a piece of market, we will provide what most of the market lacks: an easy and secure login by email or URL, an integration of chat or video call for expert advice if needed and some functions, like timeboxing, filtering  that will assist and help the user with the selection and will be integrated into the existing filesystem.
 
### Conclusions
It’s to fill the gap that other proofing apps and services have. The niche will be the high-volume commercial portrait photographer, outside of wedding and school photography. Marketing will also be extremely important as we’ll need methods for getting our app in front of people and show the benefit. One good staring point could be a plugin for Capture One and its ecosystem, which is mainly used by professional photographers.

### Scope
- The application as a Progressive Web App 
- Product website: This is where we’ll show off the product and explain how it works and why the photographer needs it.

As part of our content marketing strategy, we’ll be designing a blog that we’ll be contributing to on a regular basis in order to establish ourselves as an authority in image selection and user experience.  The blog will start with the development and document why and how it’s made and what techniques and psychology behind it are used to help the user.
